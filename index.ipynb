    "## JUMIA-PRODUCTS-RECOMMENDATION-AND-PRODUCT-REVIEW-SYSTEM\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The growth of e-commerce in Kenya has been exponential, with platforms like Jumia attracting large numbers of users. However, users frequently encounter challenges in locating relevant products due to expansive and sometimes disorganized product catalogs. Moreover, the limited use of recommendations and unreliable review systems further complicate the shopping experience, leading to reduced user satisfaction and lower conversion rates. To address these issues, we propose a recommendation and sentiment analysis system that leverages interaction history and user feedback. This system aims to provide more relevant recommendations and insights from customer sentiments, enabling Jumia to better serve its users and enhance its retail offerings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem of finding relevant products on Jumiaâ€™s extensive catalog significantly affects customer satisfaction and conversion rates. Current limitations include:  \n",
    "\n",
    "* Inadequate product recommendations based on user behavior, which leads to a lack of personalization.\n",
    "* An unreliable rating and review system, leaving customers with limited insights into product quality.\n",
    "* Limited retailer insights into customer sentiment, hindering their ability to refine offerings and optimize marketing strategies.\n",
    "  \n",
    "These issues reduce user satisfaction, decrease sales, and limit the potential for enhanced customer-retailer relationships on Jumia.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "**Primary Users (Consumers)**: Customers who frequently shop on Jumia and need relevant recommendations to streamline their product search and improve purchase decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Retailers/Sellers**: Businesses and individual sellers on Jumia who seek insights into customer preferences and sentiment to better tailor their product offerings and marketing strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Jumia Management**: The platform administrators who aim to improve customer satisfaction, engagement, and conversion rates through improved site functionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "* Develop a Recommendation System:\n",
    "\n",
    "Create an intelligent recommendation engine that uses customer interaction history, preferences, and similar behavior patterns to provide relevant product recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Implement Sentiment Analysis:\n",
    "\n",
    "Extract sentiments from customer reviews to offer meaningful feedback, categorizing it as positive, negative, or neutral. This feedback will help refine recommendations and improve customer trust in the platform.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Enhance User Experience:\n",
    "\n",
    "Improve customer satisfaction by reducing the time and effort needed to find relevant products, potentially increasing conversion rates.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Provide Insightful Retailer Analytics:\n",
    "\n",
    "Equip sellers with sentiment analysis reports and recommendation patterns to refine product and marketing offerings based on customer preferences.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Support Kenyan E-commerce Growth:\n",
    "\n",
    "Contribute to the development of the e-commerce sector in Kenya by addressing key pain points in product discoverability and review reliability on Jumia.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "We scraped data from [jumia](https://www.jumia.co.ke/) which is an online shop with more than 15 categories of products but decided to only have 15 categories\n",
